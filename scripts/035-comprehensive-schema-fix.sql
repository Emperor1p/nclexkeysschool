-- Comprehensive Schema Fix
-- This script addresses the "Database error querying schema" issue

-- Step 1: Test basic database connectivity
SELECT 'Step 1: Testing database connectivity' as info;
SELECT 
  current_database() as database_name,
  current_user as current_user,

-- Step 2: Check if we can access the auth schema
SELECT 'Step 2: Testing auth schema access' as info;
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  COUNT(*) as table_count
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'auth'

-- Step 3: Check if we can access the public schema
SELECT 'Step 3: Testing public schema access' as info;
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  COUNT(*) as table_count
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY schemaname;

-- Step 4: Check auth.users table structure
SELECT 'Step 4: Checking auth.users table structure' as info;
SELECT 
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'auth'

-- Step 5: Check if we can query auth.users
SELECT 'Step 5: Testing auth.users query' as info;

-- Step 6: Check if we can query public.users

-- Step 7: Check RLS status on all tables

-- Step 8: Disable RLS on all tables to eliminate schema issues

ALTER TABLE public.courses DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
